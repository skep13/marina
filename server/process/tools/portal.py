"""Mouse and keyboard through the desktop's own RemoteDesktop portal.

On Wayland an app can't press keys or move the pointer in other windows by
itself, but the desktop (KDE, GNOME) offers a standard way to ask: the
org.freedesktop.portal.RemoteDesktop service. The first time she uses it the
desktop shows a prompt, and the answer is remembered through a restore token.

The portal session closes when the program that opened it disconnects from the
bus, so one connection is kept for the life of the bridge. Nothing here runs
until she is first asked to use the mouse or keyboard: `available()` only looks.
